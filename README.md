## Temporary home of SPM manifest and repackaged versions of Salesforce Service SDK frameworks for iOS

While Salesforce [are retooling their CI/CD](https://github.com/forcedotcom/ServiceSDK-iOS/pull/112#issuecomment-1020301545) to produce SPM compatible versions of their iOS frameworks, we will try to maintain a compatible setup ourselves.

This repo contains a SPM Package.swift manifest and repackaged versions of the frameworks. They are downloaded form the cannonical URL in the official Cocoapods spec [here](https://github.com/goinstant/pods-specs-public/tree/master/ServiceSDK) as a `.dmg` disk image (e.g. for the first version we added 238.0.0 https://developer.salesforce.com/files/service_sdk_ios/238.0.0/ServiceSDK-238.0.0.dmg from this spec https://github.com/goinstant/pods-specs-public/blob/master/ServiceSDK/238.0.0/ServiceSDK.podspec). Then the `Frameworks` folder is manually copied in the `Versions/x.y.z` folder in the repo (e.g. [Versions/238.0.0]()) and the contained `.xcframework` bundles are individually archived in `.zip` files, since that is the format SPM supports for binary frameworks. The next step is to push these to GitHub and take the raw file URLs and put those in the respective places in `Package.swift`. Lastly, we tag the commit with the updated package file with the version of the Service SDK release, so that SPM's version resolver can get the correct manifest.
